Zen-Cart_Dynamic_Attribute_filter
=================================

<p><strong>Dynamic Filter</strong> will allow your customers to filter the products listed on any product listing page (including All Products, New Products, Featured Products, Specials and Search Results) in your store.<br>
Customers can filter by manufacturer, category, price and any attribute. </p>
<p>The module allows you among other things, to control which pages the filter appears on, the filter style (links, checkboxes or dropdowns) and also allows you to include or exclude  attributes.</p>
<p><s>The Stock by Attribute module is supported (tested on version 4.7 but should work with all versions) if installed; only items with stock will be shown in the list.</s></p>
<p>Google Event Tracking is supported and has been tested to work with Simple Google Analytics v1.2.5 but should work with all versions. </p>

This dynamic Attribute Filter version is written for Zen Cart 1.5.5, but it should be easy to prot the module back to earlier 1.5.x versions.
